$5 + 10 CHF = $10 if rate is 2:1
$5 * 2 = $10..done
	round off
	dollar side-effects...done
	make amount private...done
Dollar - 
 equals...
   Dollars with Francs
   null boundary cases ? 
 hashcode ?	
 Remove duplication: equals and times method
Instead of Dollar, Franc..Why not Currency class
  To remove Dollar/Franc subclasses...is not a single step. 
  Start from removing subclass references from client code. 
  Test cases gives us the feeler how client will access the code(leave assertions).
  Try to avoid refer sub classes directly
  Start thinking around currency class
  
Currency String constants  
    
Notes:
1) Doing TDD: Write a test
              Make it Run
              Make it Right
              Remove any code duplicacy
2) TDD tricks:
    Fake it 
    Obvious Implementation
